# Stock Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores sentiment analysis of stock market news headlines using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It aims to establish correlations between sentiment in news headlines and stock market movements. The project highlights the intersection of finance and artificial intelligence, showcasing the role of NLP in predictive analysis.

## Objectives
- Predict stock market movements using sentiment analysis of news headlines.
- Understand the impact of sentiment in news on stock price fluctuations.
- Develop robust machine learning models for financial sentiment prediction.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of NLP techniques in the financial domain.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Collection**: Headlines sourced from reliable outlets such as Bloomberg, Reuters, and Yahoo Finance.
2. **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
3. **Text Representation**: Techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF.
4. **Model Development**: Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes were implemented and evaluated.
5. **Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall were used to compare model performance.

## Tools and Technologies
### Development Environments
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive programming and visualization.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based environment with GPU/TPU support for heavy computations.

### Python Libraries
#### Core Libraries
- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`

#### NLP Libraries

## Results
| Model                 | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Logistic Regression   | 85.98%  | 0.87      | 0.85   |
| Random Forest         | 85.19%  | 0.83      | 0.89   |
| Naive Bayes           | 83.86%  | 0.85      | 0.83   |

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., social media sentiment).
- Leverage advanced deep learning models like transformers for better contextual understanding.
- Enhance preprocessing to handle sarcasm, irony, and other linguistic nuances.
- Optimize real-time performance for quicker analysis.
